# gcm
Google Cloud Messaging - client libraries

Forked from [google/fcm](https://github.com/google/gcm), and kept only the rest-client part.

I needed support for FCM, which was added in master branch and a release wan not yet made.

See [original project's](https://github.com/google/gcm) readme for more info.
